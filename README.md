# ⌨️ Typizy – Typing Speed Test Web App

Typizy is a modern, web-based typing speed and accuracy challenge designed to help users
improve their typing skills through real-time feedback and clean UI animations.

The app fetches randomized multi-line paragraphs from a public API and tracks performance
